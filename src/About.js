            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I'm known among my friends as the cinephile who always recommends the best movies of all sorts from indie movies to the big blockbusters movies. 
                Not so long ago I found myself struggling to answer my friends at 3AM in the morning when they were looking for something cool to watch they knew 
                for sure they would enjoy, so I decided to solve this problem by building movix for them. Movix uses the movies you like the most to recommend 
                new ones you will enjoy, therefore you don't waste your time on a movie you will dislike.
            </p>

            <h2>Current State</h2>
            <p>
                Right now movix is in its early stages of life, but I will enhance movix as much as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                New upgrades will get released soon...
            </p>
