            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I'm known among my friends as the cinephile who always recommends the best movies of all sorts from indie movies to the big blockbusters movies. Not so long ago I found myself struggling to answer my friends at 3AM in the morning when they were looking for something cool to watch that they knew for sure they would enjoy, so I decided to build movix for them. moviex uses the movies you like the most to recommend new movies you will enjoy, therefore you don't waste your time on a movie you will dislike.

            <h2>Current State</h2>
            <p>
                Right now movix is in its early stages of life, but I will enhance movix as much as I can.

                New upgrades will get released soon...
